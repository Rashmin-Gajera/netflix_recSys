# netflix_recSys


Developed a Netflix-style movie recommendation system (RecSys) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), 
capable of interpreting semantic intent in user queries to recommend contextually relevant movies. 

Conducted quantitative research and data analysis on movie datasets, exploring user reviews, genres, and 
metadata to identify hidden patterns and build meaningful embeddings for recommendations. 

Implemented robust web scraping pipelines using AI Agent, Big Data Analysis and Selenium to extract 
structured metadata (title, genre, plot, rating, etc.) from Google and IMDb, forming the backbone of the 
recommendation database. 

Built an internal LLM-based retrieval system powered by ChromaDB to store and query movie embeddings, 
enabling semantic search and mapping natural language user prompts to the most contextually relevant movie 
recommendations using vector similarity.
